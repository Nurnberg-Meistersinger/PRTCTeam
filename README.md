# PRTCTeam

## Introduction

This repository was developed during ETHGlobal Buenos Aires 2025 and contains the MVP source code for **PRTCT** - a Blockchain infrastructure platform that allows policyholders to prove cyber risk realization without revealing sensitive corporate data.

## Problem

The cyber insurance market has tripled since 2020 but remains inefficient due to a lack of trust. Insurers delay payouts because they do not recognize the occurrence of a cyber incident without manually verifying confidential IT infrastructure. Affected companies even refuse to receive payouts just to prevent data leaks from insurers and additional legal expenses.

We are building a platform that allows policyholders to prove the occurrence of an insured event without disclosing corporate secrets, reducing payout approval time from several months to a few hours. We replace trust with ZKP: a cyber incident can be proven only with strong evidence.
